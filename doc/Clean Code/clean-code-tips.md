# Java Developer - 25 Clean Code Tips   

1. Code should be easy to read and understand, like well-written prose.  
2. Functions should be small and do one thing only. They should not be longer than a few lines or a screenful of code.
3. Avoid global variables and other forms of shared state.
4. Functions should have a clear and well-defined interface, with minimal side-effects.
5. Write code that is expressive and easy to understand, rather than being clever or tricky.
6. Always test your code, and write your tests before you write your code.
7. Use descriptive and accurate comments, but avoid comments that simply restate the code.
8. Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), by avoiding duplication and extracting common functionality into reusable
modules.
9. Write code that is simple and direct, rather than complex and indirect.
10. Use exceptions for exceptional conditions only, and handle expected errors with return codes or other mechanisms.
11. Write code that is easy to modify and maintain, even if that means writing more code or using more memory.
12. Avoid nested loops and excessive indentation, which can make code hard to read and understand.
13. Follow **the principle of least surprise**, so that code behaves in the way that users expect it to.
14. Use design patterns and other best practices to create clean, well-structured code.
15. Avoid premature optimization, and focus on writing code that is correct, clear, and easy to understand.
16. Write tests that are automated, repeatable, and that cover all possible use cases.
17. Refactor your code regularly, to remove duplication, simplify logic, and make it more modular and maintainable.
18. Use source control tools like Git to manage your code and collaborate with other developers.
19. Use dependency injection and other techniques to manage dependencies and make your code more modular and testable.
20. Write code that is easy to debug and diagnose, with clear error messages and logging.
21. Follow naming conventions and other style guidelines to make your code more consistent and readable.
22. Always keep your code up-to-date with the latest libraries and frameworks, and refactor your code as needed to 
keep it clean and maintainable.
23. Continuously improve your skills and knowledge, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in software development.
24. Keep your functions and classes cohesive, with a clear and single responsibility.
25. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
