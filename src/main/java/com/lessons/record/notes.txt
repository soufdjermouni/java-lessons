Some frameworks may require objects with setters or a default constructor. For instance, Hibernate falls
 into this category. When creating an @Entity, we'll have to use Lombok's annotations or plain Java.

Besides, @Data objects can both extend other classes and be extended. In conclusion, if we need inheritance,
we should stick to Lombok's solutions.

In this article, we have seen that Lombok and java records are different tools and serve different purposes.
Furthermore, we discovered that Lombok is more flexible, and it can be used for scenarios where records
 are limited.
