# REST API - Best Practices
[1.] Use descriptive and meaningful resource naming -   
/users, /products, /orders

[2.] Follow the principles of the HTTP methods -   
GET /users, POST /products, PUT /users/{id}, DELETE /orders/{id} 

[3.] Utilize HTTP status codes correctly     
200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found etc.  

[4.] Provide comprehensive and clear documentation for your API -   
Detailed API documentation with usage examples, parameter descriptions, and response formats.

[5.] Use versioning to manage API changes -
/v1/users, /v2/products

[6.] Design your API to be stateless -    
Authenticate each request with an access token rather than relying on server-side sessions.

[7.] Implement proper error handling -      
```{ "error": "Invalid request body" } with an appropriate HTTP status code.```

[8.] Use appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms -    
Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based authentication and define roles/permissions for authorized users.  

[9.] Implement rate limiting and throttling -    
E.g. Allow a maximum of 100 requests per hour for a particular API endpoint per client.   

[10.] Utilize caching mechanisms -    
Set appropriate Cache-Control and ETag headers for responses that can be cached

[11.] Follow the principles of HATEOAS -      
Include hyperlinks and resource links in API responses for easy traversal and discovery.

[12.] Use pagination techniques -  
Implement pagination with query parameters like page and limit to retrieve subsets of data.

[13.] Implement input validation -   
Validate request payloads for required fields, data types, and data format.

[14.] Design your API to be idempotent -   
Ensure that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

[15.] Use appropriate content types -  
Set Content-Type: application/json for JSON payloads or Content-Type: application/xml for XML payloads.

[16.] Support content negotiation -   
Accept and return multiple representation formats based on the Accept header.

[17.] Consider implementing request/response compression -  
Compress response payload using gzip encoding when the client supports it.

[18.] Provide filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities -   
Allow clients to filter results based on query parameters like filter, sort, or search.

[19.] Implement proper version control for API documentation -  
Maintain a separate versioned documentation for each API version.

[20.] Support graceful handling of deprecated API endpoints or features -  
Clearly communicate deprecation, provide migration guides, and offer alternative endpoints.

[21.] Implement proper logging and monitoring -  
Log API requests, errors, and performance metrics. Set up monitoring tools for proactive detection of issues.

[22.] Follow RESTful URI conventions -   
Use hierarchical URIs like /users/{id}/orders to represent resource relationships.
